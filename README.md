# Inactive

Have you ever just wanted a simple way to generate HTML content easily in Javascript 
without all the weight of a virtual dom and a reactive state management? 
 
Well, this is where _Inactive_ comes in. Its compiles JSX to DOM Elements, which
can then be directly attached to the DOM. There is no state management system, 
Virtual DOM or anything fancy, so that part is up to you.
